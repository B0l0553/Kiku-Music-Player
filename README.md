# Kiku Music Player
Kiku is a music player that aims to be customizable and user-friendly. It has a real-time visualizer and a waveform visualizer. Its main qualities are that I designed it to be fast and easy to use, so that all the basic things like playing music or adding songs are easy. 

To play a music just drag and drop and voila !

A music you like is playing and you don't want to suddenly change the music too drag a new one in ? Then you can just open the playing playlist and drop it here, it will be played after the song your listening to !
